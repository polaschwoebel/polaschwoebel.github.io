    I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services where I work on Responsible AI. Before, I did a (short) postdoc doing probabilistic machine learning at the Technical University of Denmark, Section for Cognitive Systems. This is also where I got my PhD with <a href="http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~sohau/">Søren Hauberg</a> as my advisor. During my PhD I spent some time with <a href="https://mvdw.uk/#about">Mark van der Wilk</a> 's group at Imperial College London and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l8dX3ssAAAAJ&hl=en">James Hensman</a>'s team at Amazon Cambridge.
