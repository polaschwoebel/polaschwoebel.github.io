<br/>
	After obtaining my BSc in Mathematics from the Technical University of Berlin in 2016 I moved to Denmark where I studied a MSc in Machine Learning and Cognitive Science. I recently won a scholarship allowing me to carry out my PhD research at the Technical University of Denmark - you can find some details on the project <a href="https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/phd/current-phd/phd-cogsys/posc">here</a>.
	When I am not coding, puzzling over formulas or reading up on Algorithmic Fairness, I am trying to make our field better by supporting different women in tech initiatives.
