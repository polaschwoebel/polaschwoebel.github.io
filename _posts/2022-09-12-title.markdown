description: Three preprints have turned into conference papers this year.
---

I defended my PhD last week (yay!) and, of course, I did this thing where you combine all the research into one coherent linear story for the thesis. I think I did a decent job -- convince yourself <a href="https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/300326716/PhD_thesis_Pola_Elisabeth_Schw_bel.pdf">here</a> -- but really it's not 100% accurate. Doing a PhD is more like 4 years of headlessly multitasking different projects while also teaching, with long stretches of what feels like no progress at all...and then it all happens all at once! Three of my research projects resulted in conference papers this year. I might have been slightly more relaxed about my PhD had this happened a bit sooner, but a) I am happy I got to work on them until I really felt they were finished, and b) I got to go to some in-person conferences this summer! What a treat after 2 years of Zoom-conferencing. 

The work is: 
1. <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/schwobel22a.html">Last Layer Marginal Likelihood for Invariance Learning</a> which appeared at AISTATS 2022. 
2. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03637.pdf">Probabilistic Spatial Transfomer Networks</a> which appeared at UAI 2022 and 
3. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06038.pdf">The Long Arc of Fairness: Formalisations and Ethical Discourse</a> which appeared at ACM FAccT 2022. This one was extra exciting since it took place in Seoul, South Korea -- such an interesting place.
