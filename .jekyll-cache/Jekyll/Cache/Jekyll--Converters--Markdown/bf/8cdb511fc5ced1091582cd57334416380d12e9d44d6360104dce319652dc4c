I"#<p>Last month I was invited to give a talk at the AI Expo at <a href="hhttps://www.skylab.dtu.dk">Skylab</a>, DTU’s lovely space for student innovation and entrepreneurship. I gave a quick overview over the field of Algorithmic Fairness and spoke a bit about my own research. The slides can be found <a href="/img/Bias_in_bias_out.pdf">here</a>.</p>
