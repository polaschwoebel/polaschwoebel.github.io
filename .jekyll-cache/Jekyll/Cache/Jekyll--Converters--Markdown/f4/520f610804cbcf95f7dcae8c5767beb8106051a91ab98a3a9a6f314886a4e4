I":<p>My section holds a summer school on Advanced Topics in Machine Learning every year. For the first time it was organized by a PhD student - me! I chose the topic “Fairness and Machine Learning” and hosted the <a href="http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/courses/02901/"> event</a> at DTU from August 26th - 30th.</p>
