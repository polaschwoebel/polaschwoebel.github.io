I" <p>I defended my PhD last week (yay!) and, of course, I did this thing where you combine all the research into one coherent linear story for the thesis. I think I did a decent job but really itâ€™s not 100% accurate. Doing a PhD is more like 4 years of headlessly multitasking different projects while also teaching, with long streches of what feels like no progress at all. And then it all happens all at once!</p>
