I"x<p>I defended my PhD last week (yay!) and, of course, I did this thing where you combine all the research into one coherent linear story for the thesis. I think I did a decent job but really it’s not feel 100% accurate. It’s more like 4 years of headlessly multitasking different projects while also teaching, with long streches of what feels like no progress at all.</p>
