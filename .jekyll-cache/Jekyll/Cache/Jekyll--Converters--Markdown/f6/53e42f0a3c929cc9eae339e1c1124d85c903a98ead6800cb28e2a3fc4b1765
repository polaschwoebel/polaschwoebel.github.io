I"-<p>Here’s some reading that I’ve enjoyed or am looking forward to on AI Ethics and Fair ML:</p>

<p><strong>Popular science // non-fiction books</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Weapons of math destruction — <em>Cathy O’Neil</em>:
Nice outline of what I believe is the biggest ethical concern regarding ML systems: They reinforce existing biases and inequalities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data Feminism — <em>Catherine D’Ignazio &amp; Lauren F. Klein</em>:
A tour of data/AI ethics from a feminist standpoint; feminism here meant in its broadest intersectional sense (i.e. they also consider race, ability status, etc.). Quite heavy on the examples. This book is <a href="https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu"> freely available online </a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Algorithms of Oppression — <em>Safiya Umoja Noble</em>: 
Focuses on race and representation in the context of search engines.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Race after technology — <em>Ruha Benjamin</em>: 
I haven’t read this one yet, here’s what Wikipedia says: “Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code is a 2019 American book focusing on a range of ways in which social hierarchies, particularly racism, are embedded in the logical layer of internet-based technologies.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values — <em>Brian Christian</em>:
I haven’t read this one yet, it seems to be a pretty broad intro to the ethics of ML.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Invisible Women — <em>Caroline Criado Perez</em>: 
A lot of our world is designed in a data-driven way, but for historical reasons this data is often data collected on men (for example in the military). As a consequence women are, for example, 47% more likely to get injured in car accidents. Urgh.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism — <em>Shoshana Zuboff</em>:
An analysis of the problematic economics of big data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Artificial Unintelligence — <em>Meredith Broussard</em>:
“A guide to understanding the inner workings and outer limits of technology and why we should never assume that computers always get it right.”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Science writing</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>FairML book — <em>Solon Barocas, Moritz Hardt &amp; Arvind Narayanan</em>:
A textbook on fair machine learning giving an overview of the relatively young field. This is for technical readers (nothing scary but contains some math/ml). Available <a href="https://fairmlbook.org">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://facctconference.org/index.html">FAccT conference proceedings </a>: 
Latest research trends within Fairness, Accountability and Transparency in ML.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Blogs etc.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.ajl.org">Algorithmic Justice League</a>. 
The amazing <em>Joy Buolamwini</em> who started the AJL initiative and her collaborators made a documentary, it’s on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81328723">Netflix</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <a href="https://thegradient.pub/justitia-ex-machina/">article</a> on why I believe it’s useful working on ML Fairness.</p>

</ul>
