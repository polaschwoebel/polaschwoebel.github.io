I"l<p>I defended my PhD last week (yay!) and, of course, I did this thing where you combine all the research into one coherent linear story for the thesis. I think I did a decent job (arXiv soon) but really it’s not 100% accurate. Doing a PhD is more like 4 years of headlessly multitasking different projects while also teaching, with long streches of what feels like no progress at all…and then it all happens all at once! Three of my research projects resulted in conference papers this year. I might have been slighlty more relaxed about my PhD had this happened a bit sooner, hehe, but a) I am happy I got to work on them until I really felt they were finished, and b) I got to go to some in-person conferences this summer! What a treat after 2 years of Zoom-conferencing.</p>
